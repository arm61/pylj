=============

sample classes
--------------

pylj comes with four different methods for visualising the simulation that is taking place:

- JustCell
- RDF
- Scattering
- Interactions

Full information about the existing classes can be found in the sample_ class documentation.

Using the inbuild tools it is straightforward to build your own custom sample class, or to have students design their own.
