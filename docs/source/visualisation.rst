sample classes
--------------

pylj aims to provide a straightforward environment to designing custom classes for the inclusion of custom visualisation. This takes the shape of sample classes, currently pylj comes with 4:

- JustCell
- RDF
- Scattering
- Interactions
 
Using the built in pylj tools we hope that course developers and users can design custom classes to use in their on laboratory exercises.
