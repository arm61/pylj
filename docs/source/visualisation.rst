visualisation
=============

sample classes
--------------

pylj comes with four different methods for visualising the simulation that is taking place:

- JustCell
- RDF
- Scattering
- Interactions

Full information about the existing classes can be found in the sample class documentation. 
 
Using the inbuild tools it is straightforward to build your own custom sample class, or to have students design their own.
