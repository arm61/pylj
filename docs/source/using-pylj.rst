using pylj
==========

There are a number of ways to get using pylj:

- Fork the code: please feel free to fork the code on GitHub_ and add functionality that interests you. 
- Run it locally: pylj is available through the pip package manager. However, it does require a Jupyter notebooks environment. Therefore we recommend using the anaconda_ package, which gives Jupyter notebooks as well as packages such as numpy and matplotlib. Using a Windows computer, it may also be necessary to install a C++ compiler, usually the Visual C++ package_ is best.
- Use the web app: pylj is available online at the following link_. However, a password is required, please email__ to get this.
- Get in touch: Andrew_ is always keen to chat to potential users or educators so feel free to drop him an email.
